1. Is there a fault in the program? If so, locate it and explain.

Yes there is a fault which is located in the initialization of the for loop on line 3: int i = 1;
By initializing the loop counter i to 1 the program skips the first lecture which is bad.

2. Define a test case that does not execute the fault. Start from this ques-
tion, if it is possible, you should give the test case (the attendance record
with 10 values), the expected output and the actual output. If impossible,
explains the reason. Besides, you should implement the complete program,
including the functions under test, and verify your inputs along with their
corresponding outputs.

Since we cant change the code and the fault is in the main loop of the function call, there is 
no possible test case which avoids the int i = 1 error.
Here is the implemented program (I also created a C++ file which actually works too and is in this github repository):

bool fail_lecture(const vector<int>& attendance_records) {
    int absent_count = 0;
    
    for (int i = 1; i < attendance_records.size(); ++i) {
        absent_count += (attendance_records[i] == 0); 
    }
    return absent_count >= 3;
}

3. Define a test case that executes the fault but does not result in an error
state.

4. Define a test case that results in an error state but not a failure.

5. Define a test case that results in failure.
